#-----ELSBERG URN REPLICATION--- a few notes

#  - The number of red and blue marbles in the unknown urn is randomised every time the program runs
#  - The txt file 'conditionCount.txt' saves the history of allocations of each condition.
#  - The program allocates the condition once the participant gives consent, but the results and condition count
#   only update after the program has chosen a marble and shown the result.
#  - For the marble choice, the original experiment just states "each participant drew a ball from the chosen urn",
#   so I have used a similar randomisation process (shuffle list and then random choice)as used to decide the number
#   of marbles in the unknown urn.
#  - The participant is only asked for their contact details if they get a blue marble
